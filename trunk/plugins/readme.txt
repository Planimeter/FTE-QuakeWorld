Plugins are a low priority.

There are a few plugins at the moment:
emailnot: pop3/imap email notification.
emailsv: pop3/smtp email server functionality (a bit pointless - won't even compile)
ezscript: command remapping to make fte compatable with ezqauke/fuhquake/mqwcl configs. 
hud: kinda cool. But use csqc instead.
irc: an irc client: use irc nick, irc open, that'll spawn a new console in quake which can accept irc commands naturally. ctrl+tab to switch consoles. Currently native only.
serverb: server browser. The one built in is better. This one was for the sake of it. Native only, could be rewritten for qvm.
winamp: greater winamp control, and general media menu. Native only.
xsv: An X windowing system server. Absolutly bug ridden. About the only thing it runs properly is Quake. Native only, for efficiency reasons.
